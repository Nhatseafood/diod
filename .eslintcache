After building our earliest and most basic music\n              reactive lighting, we saw a sense of wonder and joy in the people\n              who saw it. Since then, our technology has evolved, as well as the\n              emotions that we evoke by making music a multi-sensory experience.\n              Our mission is to bring a new excitement to people’s favorite\n              music.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n          <Col lg={4} className=\"founders\"></Col>\n        </Row>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <Row>\n          <Col lg={4} className=\"dan\"></Col>\n          <Col>\n            <h2>FOUNDER + CEO</h2>\n            <h3>Dan Haber</h3>\n            <p>\n              Dan is the Founder and Creative Director of diod.design. During\n              his studies as an Aerospace Engineer at the University of\n              Maryland, he became obsessed with making LEDs react to music. This\n              passion has evolved from a dorm room project to what is now\n              Diod.design. Before starting this company, Dan worked as an\n              aerospace engineer at NASA in satellite operations. His\n              methodology combines his deep knowledge of hardware, systems\n              controls, and digital audio technology.\n            </p>\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <Row>\n          <Col lg={4} className=\"grant\"></Col>\n          <Col>\n            <h2>PRESIDENT</h2>\n            <h3>Grant Barrett</h3>\n            <p>\n              Grant’s role within diod.design is somewhere at the crossroads\n              between ‘Engineering’ and ‘Business.’ He received an Aerospace\n              Engineering degree from the University of Maryland and currently\n              works in mission operations at NASA.
